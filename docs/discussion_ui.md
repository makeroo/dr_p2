# Introduction

In order to discuss a problem we need to:

1. read the question

2. review proposed solutions and propose new ones

3. put thoughts (thesis) on the table

4. create relations between them

Creating relations is a n^2 problem: we have to confront
each couple of thesis to see if they contradicts each other, if one supports the other or vice versa or if they
are unrelated.

5. Vote

From the user point of view voting is very much like
creating relations or content. Whether I read something or write something, I evaluate it, though there can be some bias whether I'm the author or not.

Differences between voting and creating content from the system point of view:

 * voting can be modified or even revoked, while content
   not;

 * content is the same for every user, while voting not:
   every user express her/his vote.

These differences affects problem evaluation and decision
making process so the user *has* to be aware of it.

When the user see content it should see voting too to and be aware of it:

 * content should be as more visible as more voted it is

   * light tint -> rejected

   * darker shades of tint -> accepted

     the greater up/down votes ratio the darker

 * the tint should show if the user vote is aligned to
   the overall votes or not

   eg. *purple*: disaccord, the user voted contrary to the
               majority of the others

     *green*: accord, the user voted accordinglu to the
               majority of the others

     *black*: the user did not express a vote
