# democracy Revisited, step 2

The aim of this project is to build a web based prototype to discuss online using the solver theorized in step 1.

The prototype will be very simple and basic: just one discussion at a time.

Main goals:
* test and compare a couple of UI/UX
* verify if the whole project is a good idea or not.
